Bilkul bhai, ab de deta hoon enterprise-level ke detailed, real-world test case scenarios for Azure Web App Service‚Äîjaise ki ek enterprise team implement karegi for production-grade deployments.

I‚Äôll divide them into meaningful categories with detailed context, goals, validation strategies, and expected results‚Äînot one-liners.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ 1. Provisioning and Resource Integrity Tests

üî∏ TC-101: Validate Consistent Resource Group Creation
	‚Ä¢	Objective: Ensure the Web App and all dependent resources (App Service Plan, App Insights, VNETs, Storage, etc.) are in the correct resource group and region.
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: Scattered resources create billing and compliance chaos.
	‚Ä¢	Validation Strategy:
	‚Ä¢	Use Terraform outputs to collect all resource IDs.
	‚Ä¢	Extract resource group names and locations.
	‚Ä¢	Assert that all belong to the expected RG and region (centralus, for example).

‚∏ª

üî∏ TC-102: Validate App Service Plan Tier and Capacity
	‚Ä¢	Objective: Ensure that the App Service Plan uses the appropriate SKU (e.g., P1v3) based on environment (e.g., Dev = B1, Prod = P1v3).
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: Under/overprovisioning affects cost and performance.
	‚Ä¢	Validation Strategy:
	‚Ä¢	Fetch SKU from azurerm_app_service_plan.
	‚Ä¢	Assert correct sku.tier, sku.size, and maximumElasticWorkerCount.

‚∏ª

üî∏ TC-103: Check Deployment Slot Availability (if used)
	‚Ä¢	Objective: Ensure deployment slots (e.g., staging, canary) are provisioned.
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: Enterprises use slots for zero-downtime deployments.
	‚Ä¢	Validation Strategy:
	‚Ä¢	Use Azure SDK or CLI to list slots.
	‚Ä¢	Confirm expected slot names exist.
	‚Ä¢	Validate slot configurations mirror production slot.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ 2. Security and Compliance Tests

üî∏ TC-201: Enforce HTTPS-Only and Secure TLS Version
	‚Ä¢	Objective: Ensure that the Web App enforces HTTPS and uses only TLS 1.2 or higher.
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: Non-compliance with HTTPS or old TLS violates PCI/GDPR policies.
	‚Ä¢	Validation Strategy:
	‚Ä¢	az webapp config show --query minTlsVersion
	‚Ä¢	Simulate HTTP request and confirm redirect.
	‚Ä¢	Use SSL scanner (e.g., Qualys, or sslscan) for handshake details.

‚∏ª

üî∏ TC-202: Validate Access Restrictions (IP Filtering / Service Endpoints)
	‚Ä¢	Objective: Ensure IP whitelisting, private endpoints, or service endpoint restrictions are applied.
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: Unrestricted public access is a major attack vector.
	‚Ä¢	Validation Strategy:
	‚Ä¢	Use az webapp config access-restriction show.
	‚Ä¢	Confirm expected IP ranges or virtual network rules.
	‚Ä¢	Attempt access from unauthorized IP and confirm denial.

‚∏ª

üî∏ TC-203: Verify Authentication/Authorization Rules
	‚Ä¢	Objective: Ensure Azure AD or OAuth2-based login is enabled.
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: Anonymous Web Apps pose identity threats.
	‚Ä¢	Validation Strategy:
	‚Ä¢	Use az webapp auth show.
	‚Ä¢	Confirm enabled=true, and provider details (client_id, issuer, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Optional: attempt unauthenticated access and expect redirect to login.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ 3. Runtime Configuration and Environment Tests

üî∏ TC-301: Verify App Settings and Connection Strings
	‚Ä¢	Objective: Confirm that critical environment variables and secrets (e.g., DB connection strings, keys) are injected correctly.
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: Misconfigured apps break or leak data.
	‚Ä¢	Validation Strategy:
	‚Ä¢	Use az webapp config appsettings list.
	‚Ä¢	Verify keys like ENV, STAGE, LOG_LEVEL, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Assert encrypted connectionStrings are present with correct type (SQLAzure, Custom, etc.)

‚∏ª

üî∏ TC-302: Check Web App Stack and Platform Configuration
	‚Ä¢	Objective: Validate that the runtime (e.g., Python 3.10, Node 18, .NET 8) is as expected.
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: Wrong stacks may silently fail or behave unpredictably.
	‚Ä¢	Validation Strategy:
	‚Ä¢	Use az webapp config show ‚Üí linuxFxVersion.
	‚Ä¢	Match version with what‚Äôs defined in Terraform (runtime_stack, version).

‚∏ª

üî∏ TC-303: Validate Diagnostic Logs and Monitoring Config
	‚Ä¢	Objective: Confirm application logging is enabled to Log Analytics or Storage.
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: No logs = no observability = late detection of incidents.
	‚Ä¢	Validation Strategy:
	‚Ä¢	Use az monitor diagnostic-settings list.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure log categories like AppServiceHTTPLogs, AppServiceConsoleLogs, AppServiceAuditLogs are present and linked.
	‚Ä¢	Optional: simulate request, then confirm logs appear in workspace.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ 4. Availability and Health Check Tests

üî∏ TC-401: Confirm Application Health Endpoint is Functional
	‚Ä¢	Objective: Ensure /health or /status returns 200 OK.
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: Load balancers and autoscalers depend on health checks.
	‚Ä¢	Validation Strategy:
	‚Ä¢	Use http_helper.HttpGetWithRetry(...) in Terratest.
	‚Ä¢	Validate status code, content, and latency (< 300ms).

‚∏ª

üî∏ TC-402: Validate High Availability and Redundancy (Premium Tiers)
	‚Ä¢	Objective: Ensure multiple instances/workers are running.
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: Enterprises require failover.
	‚Ä¢	Validation Strategy:
	‚Ä¢	Check number_of_workers in azurerm_app_service_plan.
	‚Ä¢	Validate autoscaling rules if defined.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ 5. Deployment and CI/CD Pipeline Validations

üî∏ TC-501: Confirm App is Deployed from Correct Source
	‚Ä¢	Objective: Ensure deployment is triggered from CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps).
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: Manual deployment breaks change control policies.
	‚Ä¢	Validation Strategy:
	‚Ä¢	Use az webapp deployment source show.
	‚Ä¢	Confirm deployment source is VSTS, GitHub, ZIP, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Optionally test webhook integration or commit ‚Üí deploy flow.

‚∏ª

üî∏ TC-502: Validate Slot Swapping Works as Expected
	‚Ä¢	Objective: Ensure slot swap (staging ‚Üî production) behaves correctly.
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: Blue-green or canary deployments depend on it.
	‚Ä¢	Validation Strategy:
	‚Ä¢	Trigger swap via CLI or test code.
	‚Ä¢	Validate pre-swap and post-swap version identifiers.
	‚Ä¢	Confirm no downtime during swap using continuous ping test.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ 6. Terraform-Specific Tests

üî∏ TC-601: Plan Output Consistency
	‚Ä¢	Objective: After apply, running terraform plan must show no changes.
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: Drift or bad config can cause unintended diffs.
	‚Ä¢	Validation Strategy:
	‚Ä¢	Run terraform plan using Terratest shell wrapper.
	‚Ä¢	Parse and assert No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.

‚∏ª

üî∏ TC-602: Terraform Destroy Cleanup Validation
	‚Ä¢	Objective: Destroy must clean up all resources without orphaning.
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: Orphaned infra causes cost leakage and dangling risk.
	‚Ä¢	Validation Strategy:
	‚Ä¢	Run terraform destroy.
	‚Ä¢	Use Azure SDK or CLI to assert absence of resources (App, RG, Plan).

Would you like me to turn this into:
Absolutely bhai! Here‚Äôs a set of real-time enterprise-grade test case scenarios for an Azure Web App, designed to be implemented using Terratest. Each test case includes a brief scenario explanation, expected behavior, and how it reflects real production needs.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Real-Time Azure Web App Test Scenarios with Terratest

‚∏ª

üîß 1. App Service Provisioning Test

Scenario: After deploying the infrastructure using Terraform, ensure the Azure Web App has been created under the right resource group with the correct name.
	‚Ä¢	Test Case: Confirm Web App exists and is correctly named.
	‚Ä¢	Why it matters: Prevents deployment drift and misconfiguration in naming or region selection.
	‚Ä¢	Expected: Resource with given name exists in Azure under the expected location.

assert.Equal(t, *webApp.Name, "my-enterprise-webapp")
assert.Equal(t, *webApp.Location, "East US")



‚∏ª

üîß 2. App Service Plan SKU Verification

Scenario: Enterprise workloads must run on a predefined SKU (S1, P1v2, etc.) to meet performance SLAs.
	‚Ä¢	Test Case: Validate that the App Service Plan uses the correct pricing tier.
	‚Ä¢	Expected: S1 or above SKU is used, not the free or basic tier.

assert.Equal(t, *appServicePlan.Sku.Name, "S1")



‚∏ª

üåê 3. Public Accessibility & DNS Resolution

Scenario: The app should be publicly accessible post-deployment via https://<app>.azurewebsites.net.
	‚Ä¢	Test Case: Make a GET request to the hostname and check for HTTP 200.
	‚Ä¢	Expected: App returns 200 OK and correct headers (e.g., no internal errors).

statusCode := http_helper.HttpGetWithRetry(t, webAppURL, nil, 200, "Hello World", 10, 5*time.Second)



‚∏ª

üîí 4. HTTPS Enforcement

Scenario: All traffic must be encrypted using HTTPS for compliance.
	‚Ä¢	Test Case: Verify that HTTP access redirects to HTTPS.
	‚Ä¢	Expected: HTTP request results in 301 redirect to HTTPS.

‚∏ª

üîê 5. Managed Identity Availability

Scenario: Enterprise apps use Managed Identity to fetch secrets from Key Vault instead of hardcoding credentials.
	‚Ä¢	Test Case: Ensure Managed Identity is enabled.
	‚Ä¢	Expected: System-assigned identity is active and accessible.

assert.True(t, *webApp.Identity.Type == "SystemAssigned")



‚∏ª

üîê 6. Key Vault Reference Resolution

Scenario: App settings use Key Vault references like @Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=...).
	‚Ä¢	Test Case: Verify these references are resolving correctly in app configuration.
	‚Ä¢	Expected: No KeyVaultReferenceException in App Service logs.

‚∏ª

üè∑Ô∏è 7. Tagging Validation for Governance

Scenario: Each resource must have environment, owner, cost-center, and compliance tags.
	‚Ä¢	Test Case: Assert all expected tags exist and are not empty.
	‚Ä¢	Expected: Tag values are present and follow company standards (e.g., owner = devops@company.com)

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è 8. Configuration Settings Check

Scenario: Required app settings like DB_CONN, ENV=prod, and feature toggles must be set.
	‚Ä¢	Test Case: Validate app settings are correct and no sensitive data is exposed.
	‚Ä¢	Expected: DB_CONN exists, secrets are injected securely, no hardcoded secrets.

‚∏ª

üîê 9. Authentication Provider Setup

Scenario: The app integrates with Azure AD for enterprise user access.
	‚Ä¢	Test Case: Verify the identity provider is configured and active.
	‚Ä¢	Expected: Azure AD authentication is enforced, and anonymous access is disabled.

‚∏ª

üîÅ 10. Idempotency Test

Scenario: Reapplying the same Terraform config should not result in infrastructure changes.
	‚Ä¢	Test Case: Run terraform plan after initial deploy and check for ‚Äúno changes‚Äù.
	‚Ä¢	Expected: Plan is empty; config is stable and consistent.

‚∏ª

üìà 11. Performance Sanity Check

Scenario: Enterprise SLAs demand that cold starts and response times stay within 500ms for health checks.
	‚Ä¢	Test Case: Send multiple /health pings and validate response times.
	‚Ä¢	Expected: Each call responds within < 500ms consistently.

‚∏ª

üîÑ 12. Post-deployment Endpoint Validation

Scenario: After provisioning, validate live endpoints like /login, /api/status, /metrics.
	‚Ä¢	Test Case: Call each endpoint and verify expected response codes and content.
	‚Ä¢	Expected: /login returns 200 or redirects; /metrics returns Prometheus-style data.

‚∏ª

üì§ 13. App Insights and Logging Enabled

Scenario: Enterprise environments require observability.
	‚Ä¢	Test Case: Confirm diagnostic settings (App Insights or Log Analytics) are connected.
	‚Ä¢	Expected: Logs and performance metrics appear in Azure Monitor.

‚∏ª

‚ùå 14. Security Misconfig Detection

Scenario: Sometimes Terraform modules miss best practices (e.g., enabling FTP).
	‚Ä¢	Test Case: Check for disabled FTP and SCM endpoints.
	‚Ä¢	Expected: ftps_state is FtpsOnly, no plain FTP or local Git access enabled.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Summary Table
