Bilkul bhai, ab de deta hoon enterprise-level ke detailed, real-world test case scenarios for Azure Web App Service—jaise ki ek enterprise team implement karegi for production-grade deployments.

I’ll divide them into meaningful categories with detailed context, goals, validation strategies, and expected results—not one-liners.

⸻

✅ 1. Provisioning and Resource Integrity Tests

🔸 TC-101: Validate Consistent Resource Group Creation
	•	Objective: Ensure the Web App and all dependent resources (App Service Plan, App Insights, VNETs, Storage, etc.) are in the correct resource group and region.
	•	Why it matters: Scattered resources create billing and compliance chaos.
	•	Validation Strategy:
	•	Use Terraform outputs to collect all resource IDs.
	•	Extract resource group names and locations.
	•	Assert that all belong to the expected RG and region (centralus, for example).

⸻

🔸 TC-102: Validate App Service Plan Tier and Capacity
	•	Objective: Ensure that the App Service Plan uses the appropriate SKU (e.g., P1v3) based on environment (e.g., Dev = B1, Prod = P1v3).
	•	Why it matters: Under/overprovisioning affects cost and performance.
	•	Validation Strategy:
	•	Fetch SKU from azurerm_app_service_plan.
	•	Assert correct sku.tier, sku.size, and maximumElasticWorkerCount.

⸻

🔸 TC-103: Check Deployment Slot Availability (if used)
	•	Objective: Ensure deployment slots (e.g., staging, canary) are provisioned.
	•	Why it matters: Enterprises use slots for zero-downtime deployments.
	•	Validation Strategy:
	•	Use Azure SDK or CLI to list slots.
	•	Confirm expected slot names exist.
	•	Validate slot configurations mirror production slot.

⸻

✅ 2. Security and Compliance Tests

🔸 TC-201: Enforce HTTPS-Only and Secure TLS Version
	•	Objective: Ensure that the Web App enforces HTTPS and uses only TLS 1.2 or higher.
	•	Why it matters: Non-compliance with HTTPS or old TLS violates PCI/GDPR policies.
	•	Validation Strategy:
	•	az webapp config show --query minTlsVersion
	•	Simulate HTTP request and confirm redirect.
	•	Use SSL scanner (e.g., Qualys, or sslscan) for handshake details.

⸻

🔸 TC-202: Validate Access Restrictions (IP Filtering / Service Endpoints)
	•	Objective: Ensure IP whitelisting, private endpoints, or service endpoint restrictions are applied.
	•	Why it matters: Unrestricted public access is a major attack vector.
	•	Validation Strategy:
	•	Use az webapp config access-restriction show.
	•	Confirm expected IP ranges or virtual network rules.
	•	Attempt access from unauthorized IP and confirm denial.

⸻

🔸 TC-203: Verify Authentication/Authorization Rules
	•	Objective: Ensure Azure AD or OAuth2-based login is enabled.
	•	Why it matters: Anonymous Web Apps pose identity threats.
	•	Validation Strategy:
	•	Use az webapp auth show.
	•	Confirm enabled=true, and provider details (client_id, issuer, etc.)
	•	Optional: attempt unauthenticated access and expect redirect to login.

⸻

✅ 3. Runtime Configuration and Environment Tests

🔸 TC-301: Verify App Settings and Connection Strings
	•	Objective: Confirm that critical environment variables and secrets (e.g., DB connection strings, keys) are injected correctly.
	•	Why it matters: Misconfigured apps break or leak data.
	•	Validation Strategy:
	•	Use az webapp config appsettings list.
	•	Verify keys like ENV, STAGE, LOG_LEVEL, etc.
	•	Assert encrypted connectionStrings are present with correct type (SQLAzure, Custom, etc.)

⸻

🔸 TC-302: Check Web App Stack and Platform Configuration
	•	Objective: Validate that the runtime (e.g., Python 3.10, Node 18, .NET 8) is as expected.
	•	Why it matters: Wrong stacks may silently fail or behave unpredictably.
	•	Validation Strategy:
	•	Use az webapp config show → linuxFxVersion.
	•	Match version with what’s defined in Terraform (runtime_stack, version).

⸻

🔸 TC-303: Validate Diagnostic Logs and Monitoring Config
	•	Objective: Confirm application logging is enabled to Log Analytics or Storage.
	•	Why it matters: No logs = no observability = late detection of incidents.
	•	Validation Strategy:
	•	Use az monitor diagnostic-settings list.
	•	Ensure log categories like AppServiceHTTPLogs, AppServiceConsoleLogs, AppServiceAuditLogs are present and linked.
	•	Optional: simulate request, then confirm logs appear in workspace.

⸻

✅ 4. Availability and Health Check Tests

🔸 TC-401: Confirm Application Health Endpoint is Functional
	•	Objective: Ensure /health or /status returns 200 OK.
	•	Why it matters: Load balancers and autoscalers depend on health checks.
	•	Validation Strategy:
	•	Use http_helper.HttpGetWithRetry(...) in Terratest.
	•	Validate status code, content, and latency (< 300ms).

⸻

🔸 TC-402: Validate High Availability and Redundancy (Premium Tiers)
	•	Objective: Ensure multiple instances/workers are running.
	•	Why it matters: Enterprises require failover.
	•	Validation Strategy:
	•	Check number_of_workers in azurerm_app_service_plan.
	•	Validate autoscaling rules if defined.

⸻

✅ 5. Deployment and CI/CD Pipeline Validations

🔸 TC-501: Confirm App is Deployed from Correct Source
	•	Objective: Ensure deployment is triggered from CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps).
	•	Why it matters: Manual deployment breaks change control policies.
	•	Validation Strategy:
	•	Use az webapp deployment source show.
	•	Confirm deployment source is VSTS, GitHub, ZIP, etc.
	•	Optionally test webhook integration or commit → deploy flow.

⸻

🔸 TC-502: Validate Slot Swapping Works as Expected
	•	Objective: Ensure slot swap (staging ↔ production) behaves correctly.
	•	Why it matters: Blue-green or canary deployments depend on it.
	•	Validation Strategy:
	•	Trigger swap via CLI or test code.
	•	Validate pre-swap and post-swap version identifiers.
	•	Confirm no downtime during swap using continuous ping test.

⸻

✅ 6. Terraform-Specific Tests

🔸 TC-601: Plan Output Consistency
	•	Objective: After apply, running terraform plan must show no changes.
	•	Why it matters: Drift or bad config can cause unintended diffs.
	•	Validation Strategy:
	•	Run terraform plan using Terratest shell wrapper.
	•	Parse and assert No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.

⸻

🔸 TC-602: Terraform Destroy Cleanup Validation
	•	Objective: Destroy must clean up all resources without orphaning.
	•	Why it matters: Orphaned infra causes cost leakage and dangling risk.
	•	Validation Strategy:
	•	Run terraform destroy.
	•	Use Azure SDK or CLI to assert absence of resources (App, RG, Plan).

✅ Summary Matrix (Optional)

You can maintain this as a checklist in your team documentation:

Category	TC-101	TC-102	TC-103	TC-201	TC-202	…
✅ Dev	✅	✅	❌	✅	✅	
✅ Prod	✅	✅	✅	✅	✅

Would you like me to turn this into:
	•	A full Terratest Go test suite?
	•	A markdown checklist for test documentation?
	•	A spreadsheet-compatible CSV for tracking?

Let me know how you plan to organize and execute this, and I’ll help you shape it.
